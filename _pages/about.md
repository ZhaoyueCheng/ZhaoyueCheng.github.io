I'm currently a machine learning research scientist at [Layer6 AI](https://layer6.ai), I finished my Master and Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the [Univeristy of Toronto](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/).

My research interests are Recommendation Systems, Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval.
